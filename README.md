Note: Documentation will come later, but if you do use this, I ask you to donate to OpenFlights, the source for
all the data in here as of now, at http://openflights.org/donate. Seriously, if you can afford it, the OpenFlights
team is responsible for putting all this data together, all this code does is expose it as an API.
